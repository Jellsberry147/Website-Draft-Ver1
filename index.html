      I'm a Barbie Girl, in a Barbie World. My life is plastic. It's fantastic.
      You can brush my hair, I'll stop you right there you perv.

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My goal is to establish myself in the software engineering world, and to
      thrive in a field that's all about solving logical problems in creative
      ways. I have 8 years of experience in my current field where every day
      presents new opportunities to develop solutions through clear
      communication and skillful problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my favorite ways to wind down after the day's work is done is by
      spending quality time with my wife and our family. We can be playing board
      games or video games, going for a walk, or just doing our own separate
      things right next to each other on the couch. It all helps me recharge and
      get ready to get back out there and make a difference in the world around
      me! Lately, my wife and I have been challenging each other to read more
      books, and both have goals set through the Goodreads platform. I'm aiming
      for 20 books this year! üòÅ

      <summary>Project 1</summary>
      I developed an Android application to aid in playing a real world game
      with my nieces and nephews. The application featured 3 pages, several
      textboxes, accepted user input, and displayed both a video and sound.

      I can't think of another project I've worked on right now. Maybe later
