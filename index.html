      <h3 class="career">Career Ready</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to establish myself in the web development world, and to
        thrive in a field that's all about solving logical problems in creative
        ways. I have 8 years of experience in my current field where every day
        presents new opportunities to develop solutions through clear
        communication and skillful problem solving.

      <h3 class="personal">Personal Life</h3>
      <p>
        One of my favorite ways to wind down after the day's work is done is by
        spending quality time with my wife and our family. We can be playing
        board games or video games, going for a walk, or just doing our own
        separate things right next to each other on the couch. It all helps me
        recharge and get ready to get back out there and make a difference in
        the world around me!

      <h3 class="reading">Reading</h3>
      <p>
        Lately, my wife and I have been challenging each other to read more
        books, and both have goals set through the Goodreads platform. I'm
        aiming for 20 books this year! üòÅ

        <summary>Project 1</summary>
        I developed an Android application to aid in playing a real world game
        with my nieces and nephews. The application featured 3 pages, several
        textboxes, accepted user input, and displayed both a video and sound.

        <summary>Project 2</summary>
        This website has been a passion project of mine to chronicle my learning
        experience and has served as my ground zero for all of my testing. It's
        coming along pretty well, I think. :)
